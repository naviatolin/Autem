    title : Events and Task Handling
    content : Autem looks at your tasks and the amount of time you estimate them to take and breaks them up into reasonable chunks and schedules them into your free time. If you don't have any remaining time in the day, Autem will not schedule that task in  . Say you are unable to scale back in the current moment. Autem will either schedule the task earlier in the morning or later in the night than usual.

    title : Scheduling With Mental Health In Mind
    content : Autem has specific hours of the day where it won't schedule anything, thus ensuring the user can sleep. A future goal for Autem is to start recognizing patterns. If a user consistently rates their mood lower after long tasks, autem will start incorporating more breaks, making the work more frequent but shorter, so as to better fit that specific users needs.

    title : Ethics
    content : Autem was designed to help people with time management, and make sure that they take mental health into account with that. Throughout creating Autem, we knew that the mental health aspect would be just as important as the time management. We're aware that Autem could be misused. People could use our algorithms without the mental health elements we've added in, and use Autem to contribute to the toxic productivity culture that is already such a big problem.
